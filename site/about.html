  <h2 class="section-title">About Me</h2>

  <div class="content">
    <!-- <h3>About Me</h3> -->
    <p>I'm a passionate software developer with a solid foundation in Full-Stack web development. I'm proficient in multiple languages such as Python, PHP, and JavaScript. I do backend development with Laravel or Flask, where I enjoy creating
      efficient and scalable systems. On the frontend, I'm proficient in HTML, CSS, SCSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and Tailwind CSS, building visually appealing and user-friendly interfaces.</p>

    <p>I'm always eager to learn and stay up-to-date with the latest technologies. Learning new skills, languages, and frameworks is important in this always evolving field. I believe that challenging myself with new tools and technologies is key to
      staying ahead and delivering innovative solutions.</p>

    <p>I also have a passion in electronics. I enjoy working with Arduino and other microcontrollers, where I explore how to create innovative and practical solutions. My projects involve integrating hardware and software to solve real-world problems
      and making technology more accessible and functional.</p>

    <h3>ðŸŽ® Hobbies</h3>
    <p>In addition to my passion in software development, I also have a wide range of hobbies that fuel my creativity. I enjoy games which involves strategic thinking and problem-solving skills. I'm also learning sketching. Reading is another growing
      passion of mine, especially books for better understanding of the world in areas related to history, culture, and technology.</p>

    <p>I'm also interested in astronomy, history, and geography as they provide valuable insights into our universe and the evolution of civilization. Astronomy is fascinating to me because of the vastness of space and the sheer scale of the
      universe, compared to the tiny blue planet. History and geography helps in understanding of how societies have developed and interacted with their environments. How their tools and technologies along with cultures have evolved over time, the
      rise and fall of once might empires. Additionally, i also like learning languages.</p>

    <h3>ðŸ’¼ Seeking Opportunities</h3>
    <p>I am currently open to internships, full-time roles, and collaborative projects where I can apply my skills and gain experience. I'm also excited about working on projects that make a real impact, combining my
      skills with my passion for innovative solutions.</p>
